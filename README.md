API's


MUST NEED TO WORK:

NPM INSTALL ALL NECESSARY COMPONENTS ( I would add the command but I spend to much time on this already)

Need to add .env File to server code section and added the two follow lines:
DATABASE_URL: mongodb+srv://jonathanAdmin:Dragon123@syntaxshark.rm7jv.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=syntaxShark
PORT: 5713
